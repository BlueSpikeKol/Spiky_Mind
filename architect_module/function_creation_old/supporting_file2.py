  "content": "To solve this problem, we will create a Python function that iterates over the list of integers. For each integer, we will check if it is even by using the modulus operator (%). If the number is even (i.e., the remainder of the division by 2 is 0), we will add it to a running total. We will initialize this total as 0 before the loop. After the loop, we will return the total. This approach does not require any additional libraries.Here is the Python code implementing this approach:```pythondef sum_even_numbers(numbers):    total = 0    for num in numbers:        if num % 2 == 0:            total += num    return total```This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list. It does not use the sum function, as requested, and it does not require the math or itertools libraries."

  "content": "Since we are not allowed to use the sum function from Python's standard library, we will use a for loop to iterate over the list. For each element, we will check if it is an even number by using the modulus operator. If the number is even (i.e., the remainder of the division by 2 is 0), we will add it to a running total. At the end of the function, we will return the total. Let's translate this into Python code:```pythondef sum_even_numbers(lst):    total = 0    for num in lst:        if num % 2 == 0:            total += num    return total```This function begins by initializing a variable, total, to 0. It then iterates over each number in the list. If the number is even, it adds it to the total. Once it has checked every number, it returns the total."

  "content": "Analysis:To solve this problem, I will iterate through the list of integers and check if each number is even by using the modulo operator. If the number is even, I will add it to the total sum. Since we are not allowed to use the built-in Python 'sum' function, I will manually keep track of the total sum with a variable that I will initialize at 0 and increment with each even number. The time complexity of this function will be O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list, because we are performing a constant time operation (checking if a number is even and possibly adding it to the total sum) for each element in the list.\n\nCode Snippet:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    total_sum = 0\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            total_sum += number\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nUsed Libraries:\n\nNo additional libraries are used in this code snippet.\n\nComplexity Metric:\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the total sum regardless of the size of the input list.\n\nCoding Standards:\n\nThis code adheres to PEP 8, the official Python style guide. Variables and functions are named in a way that makes their purpose clear. The code is also properly indented.\n\nResource Metrics:\n\nThe function uses a fixed amount of memory to store the total sum and does not create any new data structures, so the memory usage will be low. The CPU usage will be proportional to the size of the input list, as the function needs to iterate over each element. However, this usage will be relatively low because the operations performed on each element (checking if it's even and possibly adding it to the sum) are simple and efficient."
