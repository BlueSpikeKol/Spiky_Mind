## Node Labels and Relationships Schema

### Node Labels
- `Project`
- `Objective`
- `Resources`
- `Risks`
- `Schedule`
- `Constraints`
- `Goal`
- `Team`
- `Contingencies`
- `Scope`
- `Round`
- `Trajectory`
- `DRF`

### Relationships
- `[Project] -[:HAS_OBJECTIVE]-> [Objective]`
  - Defines objectives within a project.
- `[Project|Objective] -[:HAS_PROPERTY]-> [Resources|Risks|Schedule|Constraints|Goal|Team|Contingencies|Scope]`
  - Projects and objectives can have properties detailing aspects or steps to achieve them.
- `[Objective] -[:IS_SUBOBJECTIVE_OF]-> [Objective]`
  - Allows for hierarchical structuring of objectives within projects.
- `[Resources|Risks|Schedule|Constraints|Goal|Team|Contingencies|Scope] -[:HAS_ROUND]-> [Round]`
  - Properties have rounds, representing discussions or actions.
- `[Trajectory] -[:INCLUDES_ROUND]-> [Round]`
  - Trajectories consist of multiple rounds, showing progression over time.
- `[Round] -[:PART_OF_TRAJECTORY]-> [Trajectory]`
  - Rounds are part of trajectories, linking discussions/actions to their sequence.
- `[Round] -[:DISCUSSES]-> [Resources|Risks|Schedule|Constraints|Goal|Team|Contingencies|Scope|Objective]`
  - Rounds discuss specific properties or objectives.
- `[Objective] -[:ACHIEVES_GOAL_FOR]-> [Project]`
  - Objectives directly achieve goals for projects.
- `[Resources|Risks|Schedule|Constraints|Goal|Team|Contingencies|Scope|Objective] -[:CONTRIBUTES_TO]-> [Objective]`
  - Properties and objectives contribute to the overarching project goals or to specific objectives.
- `[DRF] -[:HELPED_DECIDE]-> [Project|Objective]`
  - DRFs help decide on project directions or objective strategies.
- `[Objective|Project] -[:HAS_DRF]-> [DRF]`
  - Objectives and Projects can have a Decision Record Form associated with them for documenting decisions, rationale, and implications.
- `[Trajectory] -[:GUIDES]-> [Project|Objective]`
  - Trajectories provide a guiding framework for Projects or Objectives.
- `[Project|Objective] -[:GUIDED_BY]-> [Trajectory]`
  - Projects or Objectives are guided by Trajectories, indicating a structured approach to achieving goals.

### Simplified Rules and Constraints
- Projects are the root nodes and can encompass objectives, properties, but not rounds or trajectories directly.
- Objectives can be nested within projects or other objectives, allowing for a detailed breakdown of goals.
- Properties are specific to projects or objectives and are the only nodes that can have rounds.
- Rounds are linked to trajectories to show the sequence of discussions or actions over time.
- The schema allows tracing from any node back to its root project or objective, ensuring a clear hierarchical structure.



## Potential Entities and Relationships

### Feedback and Evaluation
- `[User] -[:RECEIVES_FEEDBACK_FROM]-> [Round]`
  - Captures feedback given by users on specific rounds or discussions.
- `[Project|Objective] -[:EVALUATED_BY]-> [EvaluationCriteria]`
  - Links projects or objectives to evaluation criteria for structured assessments.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- `[Objective] -[:DEPENDS_ON]-> [Objective]`
  - Indicates dependencies between objectives, where completion of one is required for another to begin.
- `[Task] -[:REQUIRES]-> [Resource]`
  - Shows tasks requiring specific resources for completion.

### Contributions and Collaborations
- `[User] -[:CONTRIBUTES_TO]-> [Round|Objective|Project]`
  - Tracks contributions by users to various project components.
- `[Project] -[:COLLABORATES_WITH]-> [ExternalEntity]`
  - Identifies project collaborations with external entities like organizations or communities.

### Historical and Temporal Relationships
- `[Round|Objective|Project] -[:FOLLOWS]-> [Round|Objective|Project]`
  - Establishes temporal sequences for tracking progress.
- `[Version] -[:UPDATES]-> [Round|Objective|Project]`
  - Manages version control, linking updated forms back to their predecessors.

### Knowledge and Learning
- `[Round] -[:GENERATES_KNOWLEDGE]-> [KnowledgeArtifact]`
  - Links discussions to generated knowledge artifacts like documents or models.
- `[User] -[:LEARNS_FROM]-> [Round|Objective|Project]`
  - Captures learning experiences from project involvement.

### Custom and Domain-Specific Relationships
- `[Issue] -[:BLOCKS]-> [Objective]`
  - Represents how issues or bugs block objectives in software projects.
- `[Policy] -[:INFLUENCES]-> [Project|Objective]`
  - Shows the influence of policies on project direction or constraints.

These entities and relationships offer a framework for extending the graph database to capture more nuanced interactions and dynamics within projects.
