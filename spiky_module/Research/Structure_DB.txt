Structure de la DB:

Chaque projet a un node `Project` qui est la base de l'arbre.
L'entièreté de la DB va être construite autour des nodes `Goal` qui peuvent être attaché au projet ou à d'autres objectifs


Every labels that a goal can have:
	- Goal
	- Requirements
	- Scope (in certain case is not easy to determine)
	- Ressources (ex: People, Budget, Equipment ect...)
	- Risks
	- Schedule (not always determined)
	- Constraints

Variables of a Risk:
	- Description
	- Impact
	- Severity
	- Likelihood of happening

Analysis on Risk:
	- Proposed solution
	- Migration approach

Types of Constraints:
	- Internal controls
	- Approvals
	- Regulatory
	- Ressource Constraints
	- Dependencies


Generation of the DB:
Method 1 (will use a lot of tokens):
First analyse every data available to extract all the main goal of the project.
For each goal, analyse the data again to find all the labels described above.
If a new goal is found repeat the same process for it.

To enable a precise analysis of the data, break them into the following part:
	- The form (only the answer to the question or the summarized subdiscussion)
	- Every subdiscussion from the main discussion
	- If needed the subdiscussion from the form

Problem of this solution:
Doesn't allow relation between the labels of goal.
Like labels from a goal are completely independent from label of another goal.
