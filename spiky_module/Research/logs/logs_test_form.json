            "Answer the following question with the information you have for now.\n 13. How many different coding languages are planned to be introduced through this platform?",
            "Based on the information provided, there is no specific mention of how many different coding languages are planned to be introduced through this platform. The focus of the platform appears to be on introducing basic coding concepts rather than specific programming languages. The technical architecture mentions the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript with React.js for the frontend, and Python-based Django framework for the backend. These are the technologies used in the development of the platform, but it does not explicitly state that multiple coding languages will be introduced.",
            "14. Does the platform intend to target specific grade levels within the elementary school system or is it open to all levels of primary learners?",
            "Based on the information provided, the platform intends to target elementary school children in general, rather than specific grade levels. The goal is to make technology accessible and enjoyable for the youngest learners, indicating that the platform is open to all levels of primary learners within the elementary school system.",
            "15. Will the platform have a facilitator or will it be solely user-directed learning?",
            "The context does not explicitly mention whether the platform will have a facilitator or be solely user-directed learning. However, based on the mention of mentorship from a computer science teacher, it is likely that there will be some form of facilitation or guidance available for the users. The computer science teacher could potentially provide support, answer questions, and offer assistance to the users as they navigate through the platform and engage in the learning activities. This facilitation could help ensure that users are able to effectively utilize the platform and receive guidance when needed, while still allowing for user-directed learning opportunities.",
            "16. How is the High School Coding Club planning to make this platform engaging and enjoyable for young learners?",
            "The High School Coding Club plans to make the platform engaging and enjoyable for young learners by gamifying coding concepts. They will create interactive games, puzzles, and challenges that teach basic coding concepts such as loops, conditionals, and variables. These gamified experiences will make the learning process fun and interactive, sparking curiosity and inspiring a love for coding in young children. Additionally, the platform will offer reward badges upon the completion of challenges, which can be shared on social media, providing a sense of achievement and further motivating young learners."
