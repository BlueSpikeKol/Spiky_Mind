These will cover basic concepts like variables, loops, conditions, etc., as well as specific programming languages like Python and C, and object-oriented programming. The games are designed to equip students with enough knowledge to code complex programs upon completion. The developers are currently collaborating with teachers and designers to build games that are both fun and effective in teaching programming concepts.",
        "Annually, the platform plans to have at least one update between the initial closed beta launch (exclusive to specified schools) and the global release. This is aimed at fixing any discovered problems. Future updates will incorporate programming languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. More languages may be added later. The platform aims to engage young children by collaborating with teachers and designers to develop fun, educational games tailored to teach programming concepts."
